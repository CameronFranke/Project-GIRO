startYear: year for the starting date of the historical data that will be used to generate trading models


startMonth: month for the starting date of the historical data that will be used to generate trading models


startDay: day for the starting date of the historical data that will be used to generate trading models


triggerThreshold: This value indicates the number of technical indicators that must signal an action in order for an
    action signal to be triggered for that day.


dayTriggerThreshold: This value indicates the fraction of lookback days that must signal an action in orfer for an
        action to be taken. GIRO can compute indicators for the days leading up to the "current" day. For example if you
        are looking to make a trade today you will not look at just the technical indicator values for today but for
        several days prior as well. dayTriggerThreshold indicated the percentage of the provious days that need to agree
        on an action in order for an action to be taken.


lookbackLevel: The number of previous days that GIRO will consider when making action desicions


generations: The number of generations that the genetic algorithm will run in the search for an optimal strategy


populationSize: The number of strategy elements in the population that is evolving


selectionPercentage: The portion of the population that moves on to the next generation and that will be "mated" to
    for new strategies in the population.


mutationRate: The chance that any given gene (technical indicator upper or lower bound) will mutate


mutationRateDelta: The change in mutation rate each generation. (must be negative if you want the mutation chance to decrease over time)
